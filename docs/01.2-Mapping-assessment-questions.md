## Mapping of evaluation questions to FAIR principles 

As mentioned in [section 1.5](#evaluation), we based the questions of the evaluation tool related to the categories metadata, storage and standards directly on the FAIR principles. As shown in Figure \@ref(fig:Fig-mapping), each FAIR principle translates to one or more questions. Principles that are applicable to both data and metadata are split into separate questions.
