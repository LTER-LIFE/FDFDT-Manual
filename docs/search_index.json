Jantzen &amp; Stefan J.G. Vriend 2024-06-10 Preface This interactive manual aims to provide ecologists and other data owners of ecological data with a hands-on guide on how to make your ecological data more FAIR and tackle the problems that can occur along this process. Who this guide is for This guide is for anybody who has ecological data and wants to improve their data management by making their data more FAIR, especially: ecologists who want to improve their research data management and by that make their data available for reuse by others students who collect data for their thesis and want to make their data reusable for others after their project is finished institutions and organisations that want to provide their employees with some guidance on how to increase their data maturity data stewards who … data managers who … anyone else … Why you should use this guide and improve your data management Data management is the practice of taking care of data throughout its entire lifecycle, from its collection, processing and use to its storage and sharing. Throughout the whole lifecycle, good data management is crucial to ultimately enhance the reusability of the data for yourself or others. For example, by storing your data persistently and implementing versioning, you lower the risk of data loss and have higher traceability of changes and errors. Additionally, by describing, annotating, and organising the data, it becomes better understandable for others, facilitating its reuse and increasing its impact and that of the associated research. How to read this guide This guide is designed in a way that you can only read the chapters that are relevant for improving the maturity of your data. To find these chapters, we provide you with a self-assessment tool that shows to what extent your data already complies with the FAIR principles. Directly based on the outcome of the FAIR assessment you will be provided with a tailored list of the chapters in this guide you could go through to further mature your data. You therefore do not have to read the full guide from top to bottom but should easily be able to only go through the chapters most relevant to you. Disclaimer We want to emphasise here that there is no one-size-fits-all solution and every dataset will bring its own challenges that need individual solutions. We cannot tackle all of these challenges but only give recommendations based on our own work with a range of different ecological datasets.

Research data often is stored on local hard drives, not well described or not formatted in a consistent and standard way. This makes it very difficult for others (and often even for the data owner themselves) to reuse the data or reproduce the research, because the data is not straightforward to understand, cannot be interpreted correctly, or, in case of local storage, might be unknown to others. In order to change this and increase the reusability of data, Wilkinson et al. (2015) introduced the FAIR concept together with 15 guiding principles providing guidance on how to implement it. FAIR stands for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable, which more concrete means the following: Findable. This means that the metadata (and the data) can be easily found by humans and computers and that machine-readable metadata allows for automatic discovery of the data by machines. Accessible. It is clearly stated how the user can access the data and whether, for example, authorisation or authentication are required. Interoperable. In order to integrate the data with other data and to incorporate it into workflows or applications, the data needs to be fully compatible with other data. In easier words this means that data resources should ‘speak the same language’ to be used together. Reusable. The ultimate goal of the FAIR concept is to make the data reusable, which means that there is proper annotation in the form of metadata that allows users (and machines) to understand the data and correctly interpret it. 1.2 Extending FAIR In our guide we will extend FAIR as it would be strictly defined by the FAIR principles in order to make it workable in practice. This means that we also include the component of structuring your data into the process of FAIRifying it. Structured. Structuring your data, so organising it in a tidy way, can clearly make the data easier to access for others and enhances its understandability. We therefore think that this is a crucial component of increasing the reusability of your data. 1.3 FAIR is not open It is important to stress here that FAIR is not equal to open. While the metadata of your data should be openly available, informing others about the existence of your data, the data itself does not have to be open. If you have reasons for not making the data openly available to everyone (e.g., because it contains sensitive information), this can and should be made clear in the metadata where according licensing information and access rights can be provided. As long as this is guaranteed, restricted or closed data can also be completely FAIR. 1.4 Why should your data be FAIR? Depending on the current maturity of your data, making data FAIR certainly requires some effort, but the benefits are evident both for yourself and for others. Findable and well annotated data facilitates your own reuse of your data in the future and the reuse of your data by others, which simultaneously increases the visibility and the impact of your research. Increasing the interoperability of the data additionally increases the possibilities for collaborations and will in total benefit the scientific community. 1.5 FAIR assessment of your data As stated before, every dataset is different and datasets can vary widely in their level of FAIR. FAIR is a gradient (see also FAIR Data Maturity Model. Specification and Guidelines of RDA) and different datasets can fulfil different criteria of FAIR but reach the same overall level of FAIRness. It is therefore important to first assess which state your data is in and what steps your data need to be improved. There are already a range of FAIR assessment tools (see here for an overview), which score your data but there is much less guidance on how to actually improve the FAIRness of your data. Next to questionnaire-based assessment tools, there are also tools available that automatically assess the FAIRness of your data. Most of them however require the data to be already stored on an online repository, which is not the state at which we want to start with our FAIR assessment. We therefore developed our own tool that provides you with a set of simple questions about four properties of your data: metadata, storage, standards and structure. Metadata is data about your data and contains information about the who, where, what, when and how of data collection allowing another user of your data to understand and reuse it without prior knowledge of the data. Storage is about whether your data is stored persistently and in a way that makes it findable and accessible to others. Standards describe uniform, community-accepted formats in which both data and metadata are stored and which enhance compatibility with other datasets. Structure is about whether your data is organised in a consistent and logical way. Besides the questions about structure, they are all directly based on the FAIR principles. Figure 2 visualises how the data properties in the assessment link to the letters of FAIR. Your answers will provide you with a circle-diagram showing how mature your dataset is in each of the properties and connected to that a list of chapters of this manual you can work through to further improve the maturity of your data. It will likely be difficult to reach the full score in all of the properties of your data, but this also not necessarily the aim of this assessment or guide. Every improvement is already a great step! Especially the components that link to interoperability are more difficult to implement, as true interoperability generally is a big challenge within and across disciplines (Pagano et al., 2013). One step to reach interoperability is to use a language for knowledge representation and linked data, such as RDF (Resource Description Framework). However, as this is more the expertise of data or information scientists instead of ecologists, we will not look into these topics in this guide. "],["example-datasets.html", " 2 Example data sets 2.1 Bud burst data 2.2 Beech crop data 2.3 Cricket data 2.4 CLUE field vegetation cover data (i.e., CLUE data)", " 2 Example data sets To illustrate the process of FAIRifying ecological data we will rely on several example data sets we used to develop this guide. These data sets were selected because they cover a broad variety of different structures and different levels of FAIR, ranging from observational to experimental data and from highly unstructured and undocumented data to data that already fulfils some of the FAIR principles. 2.1 Bud burst data The first dataset contains long-term data on the phenology of different tree species. Every year in spring, deciduous trees develop new leaves from their buds at a certain point in time. The timing of this can be crucial for herbivores, such as caterpillars, relying on newly emerging leaves as an important food source. To monitor shifts in tree phenology, the Department of Animal Ecology at NIOO has assessed leaf development every year since 1988 by scoring the stage of bud opening on a fixed scale (cf. Visser &amp; Holleman, 2001). 2.2 Beech crop data A second data set collected by Animal Ecology/NIOO contains data on the amount of beech mast per year since 1976. Low, intermediate and high seed production in beech (Fagus sylvatica) trees alternate periodically over years. Since beech nuts are an important winter food resource for several species, such as passerine birds, seed availability is monitored yearly by collecting beech nuts in determined grids under a set of trees. These nuts are counted and weighted and based on this a so-called beech crop index can be calculated (cf. Perdeck et al., 2000). 2.3 Cricket data The third data set contains experimental data on invertebrates belonging to the publication of Vogels et al., 2021. They tested whether changes in plant N:P ratios following sod-cutting constrain the reproductive potential in the European field cricket (Gryllus campestris). Different phosphorus and liming treatments were applied to vegetation plots in the heathlands of the Veluwe and the plants of these plots used in a feeding experiment in which the reproductive success of the female crickets was measured. 2.4 CLUE field vegetation cover data (i.e., CLUE data) The last example dataset consists of data on vegetation cover collected in a long-term grassland biodiversity field experiment site in the Veluwe, Netherlands, also abbreviated as CLUE fields (= changing land usage, enhancement of biodiversity and ecosystem development). Data collection started in 1996 and was conducted by the Department of Terrestrial Ecology of NIOO-KNAW. On a former agricultural field, experimental plots have been established in a random block design and different sowing treatments (high diversity, low diversity, continued agricultural rotation, and natural succession), as well as soil inoculation treatments have been applied in two different experiments in 1996. In both experiments, percent cover of each occurring plant species is measured annually. The data of both experiments result in two independent datasets, they are however very similar and their FAIRification process was nearly the same so that they will be treated as one dataset, called CLUE data, in the following. "],["workflow.html", " 3 Workflow", " 3 Workflow The general workflow that we present in this guide to make your data more FAIR is shown in Figure ?? and shortly described in the following section. To make your data more FAIR, you should: First, describe your data and thereby gather metadata. Afterwards, you should decide whether your raw data should be mobilised to an online repository. If yes, you have to choose a suitable repository and upload your metadata and data there. Next, you can start to standardise both the data and the metadata. With which of the two you start does not matter, as they can both be structured and standardised separately. For the metadata: First, choose a metadata standard. Next, map the metadata to the selected standard. For the data: First, choose a suitable data standard. Then, map the data to that standard. For further standardisation of your data, use ontologies and biological taxonomies where possible to describe the contents of the data. After standardising the data, you should choose a standardised structure for the data. Restructure your data according to the chosen structure. Once standard and structure are applied, structural metadata can be created that describes how the data is organised in its new form. As a last step your standardised data and metadata should be persistently stored in an online storage. If you have not chosen a repository before (or if you want to store the standardised data elsewhere), you should: choose a suitable repository that accepts your new data structure/format. mobilise the data and the metadata to the chosen repository. Even though this guide is tailored to ecological data, the workflow presented here should be generally applicable to any type of data, only the implementations of each step will differ. In the following chapters, we will go through each of the steps and provide some general background, introduce some options for implementation for ecological data and considerations that can help to choose the best suited option for your data, as well as a short insight into our own choices for the example datasets.
