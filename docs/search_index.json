[["09-completely-FAIR.html", " 4 How to be completely FAIR", " 4 How to be completely FAIR As stated before, you cannot reach the full score in the standard section of the assessment of your data by going through this guide alone, as it is not covering the implementation of the FAIR principle I1: (Meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation. Using, for example, RDF (Resource description framework) or OWL (Web ontology language) for knowledge representation and transforming the data accordingly, is more the task of data scientists rather than ecologists and was therefore falling out of the scope of this guide. If you are however interested in making your data fully FAIR and cover principle I1, the following resources can be a good starting point: Open data support - Training Module 1.3: Introduction to RDF &amp; SPARQL Darwin Core RDF guide Cambridge semantics - Semantics university: Learn RDF W3C Web Ontology Language guide "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
