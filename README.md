# Project description

This project builds the `bookdown` generated book "A hands-on guide to FAIR and structured ecological data" which is the outcome of the [FAIR Data for Digital Twins](https://github.com/LTER-LIFE/FDFDT) project of [NIOO-KNAW](https://nioo.knaw.nl/) and [DANS-KNAW](https://dans.knaw.nl).

The book is tailored at anyone who has ecological data and provides them with practical, experience-based guidance on how to make this data more FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable) and structured. 

The guide comes together with an assessment tool with which the user can assess the maturity of a dataset. Based on the state of the data in four properties (metadata, storage, standards and structure) the user will then be provided with the corresponding chapters in the guide with which the maturity of the dataset can be improved.
