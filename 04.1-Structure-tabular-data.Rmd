## Structuring your tabular data

A common way of storing biodiversity data is in tables. However, entering the data in a spreadsheet does often not adhere to the strict requirements of tabular data. 

**Characteristics of tabular data:**

- Structured in rows and columns

- Rectangular shape, in which each row has the same number of columns and each column the same number of rows

- Cells in a row/column can be left empty

- The columns describe properties of the entities that are described by the rows. 

For a more extensive description of the tabular data model, see [here](https://www.w3.org/TR/tabular-data-model/).

To standardise the data and make it reusable to others and to follow the remaining steps of this guide, it is a necessary prerequisite that data that should be tabular follows these characteristics. You should therefore reshape your data accordingly.
