# Standardise and structure your metadata

Once you have described your data and assigned [metadata](#metadata) to it (see [chapter 4](#describe-data)), you can make your data more FAIR by also mapping your metadata to a standard format. Similar to data standards described in a previous section, there are also several metadata standards available to do so. The distinction between metadata standards and data standards is however often not that clear and [Darwin Core](#DwC) sometimes is also referred to as a metadata standard.

## Metadata standards (for biodiversity data)

As with the data standards, a wide range of metadata standards exists, partly tailored to specific research domains.

For ecological data, a widely used metadata standard, for example by [OBIS](#OBIS) and [GBIF](#GBIF), is the [**Ecological metadata language (EML)**](#eml), which is also the required format for metadata in the [Darwin Core Archives](#DwC-A). It consists of a set of defined terms used to describe metadata and is compatible with other community standards. EML uses a readable [XML](#XML) markup syntax that balances the machine and human readability and is structured in modules making it relatively flexible in describing metadata. The developers provide a good overview of all the modules and EML terms together with important details and definitions in their [interactive schema documentation](https://eml.ecoinformatics.org/schema/).

**Dublin Core** is a metadata standard consisting of a set of 15 terms used to describe metadata. The terms themselves consist of several dozen properties, classes, data types, and vocabulary encoding schemes and are maintained by the [Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI)](https://dublincore.org/).

## Tools to help you

-   The [metadata standard catalog](https://rdamsc.bath.ac.uk/), provides a nice overview of the different metadata standards and is searchable, for example, for specific topics.

## Our choice

For all of our datasets we choose EML as the metadata standard because it is very flexible and provides all the necessary terms to describe our metadata. Especially through its terms about spatial, temporal and taxonomic coverage it captures the key elements of our datasets and is much better suited to describe ecological data then Dublin Core, for example. Additionally, as we went with Darwin Core Archives to structure the data, EML was required to use as a metadata standard.

## EML terms

EML consists of a wide range of terms of which some are required, while others might just be nice to have depending on what information your metadata contains. In general, terms can have several levels of subterms and we will not cover all of them here (detailed information on every term can be found [here](https://eml.ecoinformatics.org/schema/) and some best practices [here](https://ediorg.github.io/data-package-best-practices/eml-best-practices.html)). For all terms containing text the "xml:lang" attribute should be added if the language is not English. Be aware that EML terms use the spelling of American English.

[**Required terms**]{style="color: #d111d4ff;"}

EML comes with only three terms that are required to make the EML document schema valid.

-   [`<title>`]{style="color: #d111d4ff;"}: a brief title that provides enough information to distinguish this dataset or resource from others and makes clear what the data is about. The "xml:lang" attribute can be used to specify in which language the title is given, which is especially useful if you want to give alternative titles in different languages.

-   [`<creator>`]{style="color: #d111d4ff;"}: information on the person or organisation that created the dataset

-   [`<contact>`]{style="color: #d111d4ff;"}: information on the person or organisation that contacted about the data, e.g., if questions arise

[**Highly recommended terms**]{style="color: #dd7f08ff;"}

The following set of terms is not strictly required by EML but we would highly recommend to provide as much of them as possible, as this increases the richness of the metadata and provides valuable information about the data that is helpful for others to understand and reuse the data.

-   [`<metadataProvider>`]{style="color: #dd7f08ff;"}: information about the person that has provides the metadata in the EML file

    **Creator, contact and metadataProvider** The creator and the contact can either be a named person, a certain position that is always staying the same even though the people in the position might change, or an organisation. For each of these cases, different subterms exist in all three terms (including metadataProvider) to describe the person/position/organisation accordingly. It is therefore required to choose at least one of the terms `<individualName>`, `<organizationName>` or `<positionName>`.

    -   `<individualName>`: the name of an individual person can be given with three subterms:

        -   `<salutation>`: can be a title (e.g., "Dr.") or another salutation ("Mr."/"Ms.")
        -   `<givenName>`
        -   `<surName>`

    -   `<organisationName>`

    -   `<positionName>`

    -   `<address>`

    -   `<city>`

    -   `<postalCode>`

    -   `<country>`

    -   `<electronicMalAddress>`

    -   `<userID>`: an identifier that links the person or organisation to a directory if individuals, e.g., an ORCID. This terms requires the attribute `<directory>` to state which directory the ID refers to and will generally be an URL (e.g., <https://orcid.org>)

The contact, creator and metadataProvider can be different people/organisations/positions but can also all be the same. In the latter case, do this.

-   [`<language>`]{style="color: #dd7f08ff;"}: provides the language the resource is written in and can either be a well-known language name or ideally, a [ISO language code](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_language_codes.asp)

-   [`<abstract>`]{style="color: #dd7f08ff;"}: a short summary of the data that includes basic information to give an idea what the data is about.

    -   `<para>`: Text is stored in this subterm, which can either directly have a text string or a set of subterms consisting of markup tags allowing for formatting of the text.

-   [`<keywordSet>`]{style="color: #dd7f08ff;"}: can either be one or many keywords describing the resource

    -   `<keyword>`: each keyword is stored separately in this subterm as text.
    -   `<keywordThesaurus>`: If the keywords are part of a thesaurus, it can be specified which thesaurus they are derived from.

-   [`<coverage>`]{style="color: #dd7f08ff;"}: Describes the spatial, temporal and taxonomic coverage of the resource.

    -   [`<temporalCoverage>`]{style="color: #dd7f08ff;"}: information on what time span is covered in the data. Use [ISO 8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html) (i.e., YYYY-MM-DD) for date and time information. Needs either one of the subterms:
        -   `<singleDateTime>`: describes a single date and time either by describing a calendar date or a geologic date, using the subterms:
        -   `<calendarDate>`
        -   `<time>`
        -   `<alternativeTimeScale>`: can describe alternative time scale, e.g., geological date, with a range of subterms
        -   `<rangeOfDates>`: allows to describe a time range by specifying start and end date (with the same subterms as for singleDateTime). Can be repeated if there are several time ranges that need to be described.
        -   `<beginDate>`
        -   `<endDate>`
    -   [`<geographicCoverage>`]{style="color: #dd7f08ff;"}: information about the spatial extent of the data that should be given as text and coordinates with the subterms:
        -   `<geographicDescription>`: short text explanation of the spatial extent
        -   `<boundingCoordinates>`: stating the four edges of a bounding box, by giving:
        -   `<westBoundingCoordinate>`
        -   `<eastBoundingCoordinate>`
        -   `<northBoundingCoordinate>`
        -   `<southBoundingCoordinate>`
    -   [`<taxonomicCoverage>`]{style="color: #dd7f08ff;"}: information about the taxa covered in the data
        -   `<generalTaxonomicCoverage>`: text description of the taxa included in the data
        -   `<taxonomicClassification>`: taxonomic classification of the range of taxa included in the data, specified through a set of subterms:
            -   `<taxonRankName>`: taxonomic level of information
            -   `<taxonRankValue>`: taxonomic nam
            -   `<commonName>`
            -   `<taxonID>`: identifier of the taxon from a certain provider that has to be specified with the attribute "provider" containing a [URI](#URI) (e.g., provider = "<https://eol.org>" if the taxon ID is retrieved from EOL)

-   [`<maintenance>`]{style="color: #dd7f08ff;"}: information on with which frequency the data is updated and whether data collection is still ongoing

    -   `<maintenanceUpdateFrequency>`: needs to be filled with a term of the EML MaintUpFreqType, for example: annually, asNeeded, biannually, daily, irregular or unknown
    -   `<description>`: text description of maintenance stated with subterm
    -   `<para>`

-   [`<methods>`]{style="color: #dd7f08ff;"}: stepwise information on methods for data collection

    -   `<methodStep>`: can be repeated for each method step and includes a range of subterms to specify instruments, software, protocols, descriptions and citations of the methods

-   [`<pubDate>`]{style="color: #dd7f08ff;"}: publication date of the resource in [ISO 8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html) (i.e., YYYY-MM-DD)

-   [`<licensed>`]{style="color: #dd7f08ff;"}: information on the licence of the data and how it can be used by others, for information in which licence to assign see chapter licencing

    -   `<licenseName>`: official name of the licence
    -   `<url>`: [URL](#URI) referring to the licence (e.g., <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>)
